Chat models are typically fine-tuned on datasets formatted with a prompt template. 
These chat templates are programmed recipes that convert a chat conversation into a single string. 
At prediction time, it’s standard to match an LLM’s expected chat format – not doing so is oft-noted as causing performance degradations. 
However, do we in fact see these degradations on evaluation benchmarks?
